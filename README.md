## About this App:

This application was created in free pascal using <a href="https://www.pilotlogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Typhon Studio</a> which is a fork of [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

The source code is a companion to my [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/EE6NcXnxMfY) on how to scrape a website.  Although I reccommend using a website's [API](https://unsplash.com/developers) for getting content, this is a **friendly low volume app** intended to teach the basics of web scraping when an API is not available.
